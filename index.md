title: About Me
---

Hey there! I have been working in the data analytics profession, focused on the insurance industry, for about 15 years now ([this is me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wjanet)). With the recent leaps in technology and data collection, I think a huge opportunity has been created for using new mathematical techniques in data analysis and machine learning. I hope to leverage my intellectual curiosity and analytical skills to add value in this quickly evolving field. 

In my free time, I work on general interest data projects, Kaggle competitions and Project Euler. Check out my [projects page](/projects) for some samples. I also write in the [Human in a Machine World](https://t.co/on0aJhvp63) publication on Medium and [Managing Analytics](https://daal.substack.com/) on Substack.
