title: About Me
---

Hey there! I have been working in the data analytics profession, focused in the insurance industry, for about 9 years now. Over the course of my career, I have worked mainly with R and Excel/VBA and have dabbled in a variety of business intelligence tools.

With the recent leaps in technology and data collection, I think a huge opportunity has been created for using new mathematical techniques in data analysis and machine learning. I hope to leverage my intellectual curiosity and analytical skills to add value in this quickly evolving field. 

In my free time, I work on general interest data projects, Kaggle competitions and Project Euler. Check out my [projects page](/projects) for some samples. I also write in the [Human in a Machine World](https://medium.com/human-in-a-machine-world) publication on Medium.
